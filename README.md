# live-slideshow
A relatively simple combination of PHP and javscript jQuery cycle2 to create a slideshow that auto refreshes every few seconds to add newly created jpg files in the image folder to the slideshow.

There is also a div#sidebar that you can delete if you don't want it.  It was initially setup to show 4:3 iphone photos that were airdropped to a laptop and show on a 16:9 tv after a few seconds.

I'm using local copies of jQuery and jQuery Cycle2 so this will work offline or in adhoc mode between the phone and laptop.
